# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Which spatial resolution shall be used to perform the test case simulations?
The spatial resolution of the model input data is 5 meters (regular grid) and the result fields are required to also have a spatial resolution of 5 meters. However, this applies to the submitted result fields, the simulations can be performed using your default numerical setup (also if using a different spatial resolution), but they need to be submitted as rasters with a cell size of 5 meters.
